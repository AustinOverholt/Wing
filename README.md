# Wing

Wing was built as an application to solve transportation issues related to large events in Los Angeles.
It was built for the Automobility LA Hackathon at the LA auto show and won 2nd place.
We used multiple APIs from the LA Department of Transportation as well as Honda's Telematics API for communicating with their vehicles. 

## Usage

Users who are coming to LA for the first time or who need to see where things are busy are able to use Wing to find their way around. Implementing the cities data on public parking lots and parking meters we were able to determine where a user could go to park.

## Demo

A demo of the site is running on Azure [here](http://teamwing.azurewebsites.net/). Be aware that the site is mobile optimized only at this point.
